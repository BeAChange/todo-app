Slide 1: Title Slide
•	Title: Green Code: Saving the Planet with CO2.js
•	Subtitle: How Developers Can Build Sustainable Software
________________________________________
Slide 2: Introduction & Context
•	Why This Matters:
“The software we build doesn’t just impact the users—it impacts the environment too. Did you know that the energy consumption of software applications is a major contributor to carbon emissions? In fact, the global tech industry accounts for roughly 2-3% of the world’s CO2 emissions. With billions of devices and applications running every day, small changes in how we write code can make a big difference in reducing energy consumption.”
•	Today’s Goal:
“In the next 20 minutes, I’ll give you a quick but powerful introduction to how developers can optimize their code for sustainability using CO2.js, a tool that helps measure and minimize the carbon footprint of your JavaScript code. We’ll also look at how to integrate it directly into your CI/CD pipeline and measure the impact of frontend packages in a GitLab environment.”

Slide 3: What is CO2.js?
•	Introducing CO2.js
“CO2.js is an open-source library designed to help developers assess and reduce the carbon footprint of their code. It analyzes various aspects of your JavaScript code and provides insights into how much energy it consumes.”
•	Key Features:
o	Measures energy consumption of JavaScript code.
o	Provides real-time carbon footprint feedback.
o	Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
•	How It Works:
“CO2.js works by estimating how much energy is consumed while executing certain operations, and it computes an approximate CO2 emission figure based on this. By integrating this into your development lifecycle, you can gain immediate feedback on the environmental cost of your code.”

Slide 4: Developer’s Role in Sustainability
•	How Developers Impact Sustainability:
“As developers, we have more power than we realize. A single piece of inefficient code, unnecessary API calls, or a bloated frontend package can lead to significant energy consumption when scaled. It's our job to understand the trade-offs between functionality, performance, and sustainability.”
•	Key Areas to Focus On:
o	Code Efficiency: Writing leaner, optimized code.
o	Reducing Network Calls: Minimize unnecessary HTTP requests.
o	Optimizing Frontend Packages: Use lighter dependencies, reduce bundle size.
o	Energy-Aware Development: Measuring energy consumption early in development.

Slide 5: Hands-On Demo Introduction
•	Live Coding Setup:
“Alright, let’s switch gears and do a live demonstration to see how you can implement CO2.js into your workflow.”
•	What We’ll Cover:
o	Installing CO2.js and adding it to your project.
o	Integrating CO2.js into your GitLab pipeline.
o	Demonstrating how it works in real-time for both small and large frontend packages.

Slide 6: Live Coding – Installing CO2.js
1.	Step 1: Installing CO2.js
o	"We’ll begin by installing the CO2.js library into a simple JavaScript project. This is as easy as running npm or yarn install."
2.	npm install @tgwf/co2 --save-dev
3.	Step 2: Basic Code Integration
o	“Once installed, we can import the CO2 module into our JavaScript file to start measuring.”
4.	import co2 from '@tgwf/co2';
5.	
6.	// Example function
7.	function fetchData() {
8.	  co2.start();  // Start measuring CO2 footprint
9.	
10.	  fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
11.	    .then(response => response.json())
12.	    .then(data => {
13.	      console.log(data);
14.	      co2.stop();  // Stop measuring and log the carbon footprint
15.	    })
16.	    .catch(error => {
17.	      console.error('Error:', error);
18.	      co2.stop();
19.	    });
20.	}
o	“You can see that we’re wrapping the fetch request with co2.start() and co2.stop() to measure how much CO2 is consumed by this API call.”

Slide 7: Integrating CO2.js in GitLab CI/CD Pipeline
1.	Step 1: GitLab Pipeline Integration
“Next, let’s integrate CO2.js into the GitLab CI/CD pipeline. The goal here is to automatically measure the carbon footprint of our code whenever a new commit is pushed.”
2.	stages:
3.	  - test
4.	  - deploy
5.	
6.	test:
7.	  stage: test
8.	  script:
9.	    - npm install
10.	    - npx co2-cli
“In the GitLab CI pipeline above, we install the dependencies and run npx co2-cli, which will analyze the energy consumption of our code and provide insights on potential improvements.”
11.	Step 2: Viewing Results
“You can view CO2.js results directly in the pipeline output. If there are any significant inefficiencies or high carbon footprints, they will be flagged immediately.”

Slide 8: Measuring Frontend Packages
•	Measuring Carbon Footprint of Frontend Packages:
“Let’s take a moment to focus on frontend package optimization. This can have a huge impact on reducing the energy consumption of your application. CO2.js allows you to measure the footprint of your JavaScript dependencies, so you can make informed decisions about which libraries or frameworks to use.”
•	Example: Measuring a Large Package
“Imagine you’re working with a large library like react or lodash. Here’s how you might check the energy consumption of that dependency.”
•	npx co2-cli measure react
“By running this command, you can see how much energy your react package consumes during development or production. Smaller, optimized libraries can save a lot in the long run.”

Slide 9: Best Practices for Sustainable Code
•	Optimize JavaScript:
“Always strive to write efficient code. Use modern syntax and avoid deprecated methods that consume more resources.”
•	Choose Efficient Libraries:
“Use lightweight libraries and be mindful of dependencies. It’s often better to build a custom solution rather than loading a large library with unnecessary features.”
•	Minimize Network Traffic:
“Reduce the number of network requests, and consider caching strategies to limit unnecessary data transfers.”
•	Use Tree Shaking and Code Splitting:
“Modern bundlers like Webpack can help eliminate unused code, making your bundle smaller and faster to load.”

Slide 10: Q&A / Discussion
•	“That’s the core of today’s demo. Now, I’d love to hear your thoughts and questions. Are there any aspects you’d like me to dive deeper into, or any challenges you’ve faced trying to make your code more sustainable?”
________________________________________
Slide 11: Conclusion & Next Steps
•	Key Takeaways:
o	Sustainability in code is crucial, and small optimizations can add up.
o	Tools like CO2.js help measure and minimize the environmental impact of your code.
o	You can integrate CO2.js into your CI/CD pipeline and measure package footprints for better decisions.
•	Call to Action:
“I encourage you all to start using CO2.js in your own projects. It's a simple tool, but it can have a significant impact on your code’s sustainability. Let’s build greener software, together.”
